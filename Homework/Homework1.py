# --- LESSON 1 HOMEWORK ---

# Part 1: Assign Data Types
# TODO: Assign appropriate data types to the following variables:
# - city (string)
# - temperature (float)
# - population (integer)
# - is_raining (boolean)

city = ""  # TODO: Assign a city name
temperature = 0.0  # TODO: Assign the city's temperature
population = 0  # TODO: Assign the city's population
is_raining = False  # TODO: Indicate if it's raining

# TODO: Print the type of each variable
# Example: print(type(city))

# Part 2: Type Conversion & Operations
# TODO: Write a Python script that:
# 1. Takes user input for a product's price (float) and quantity (int).
# 2. Calculates the total cost as price * quantity.
# 3. Convert the total cost to an integer and print both float and integer values.

# TODO: Add code here to prompt for price and quantity inputs

# TODO: Calculate total cost
total_cost = 0  # Calculate total cost (price * quantity)

# TODO: Print total cost as float and integer
print("Total cost (float):", total_cost)
print("Total cost (int):", int(total_cost))

# BONUS:
# TODO: Prompt for the user's name and print a message
# Example: print(f"Thank you, {name}, for your purchase of {quantity} items.")

# Part 1: Lists
# TODO: Create a list of your favorite animals. Add at least 5 animals to the list.
# Perform the following operations:
# 1. Add a new animal to the list.
# 2. Modify the second animal in the list.
# 3. Remove the last animal from the list.
# 4. Print the final list.

animals = []  # TODO: Add your favorite animals here

# TODO: Add code to perform the operations on the animals list

# Part 2: Tuples
# TODO: Create a tuple representing the coordinates of a point in 3D space (x, y, z).
# Print the values of x, y, and z.

coordinates = ()  # TODO: Create a tuple with 3 values

# TODO: Unpack the tuple and print each value

# Part 3: Dictionaries
# TODO: Create a dictionary to store information about a book.
# The dictionary should have the keys: "title", "author", "year_published".
# Perform the following operations:
# 1. Add a new key "genre".
# 2. Modify the "year_published" value.
# 3. Remove the "author" key.
# 4. Print the final dictionary.

book = {}  # TODO: Create a dictionary with book information

# TODO: Add code to perform the operations on the dictionary

# Part 4: Sets
# TODO: Create a set of unique numbers. Add at least 5 numbers.
# Perform the following operations:
# 1. Add a new number to the set.
# 2. Remove a number from the set.
# 3. Perform a union with another set {10, 20, 30}.
# 4. Perform an intersection with another set {1, 2, 3}.
# 5. Print the final set.

numbers = set()  # TODO: Add unique numbers here

# TODO: Add code to perform the operations on the set
